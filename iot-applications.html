    <h1>IoT Applications for kick starting your web development journey</h1>
    
    <h2>Activity 1</h2> <!--Activity 1-->

    <p>What is an IoT application?</p>
    
    <pre>
    An IoT application or Internet of Things are applications which are 
    used to control the hardware through the use of a simple interface 
    build using web technologies such as python, html, css, js etc.

    </pre>
    
    <p>What are the main Features needed?</p>

    <p>What does smart mean?</p>

    <pre>
    
      Smart building refers to a building which is automated to a certain extent 
      in order to reduce human effort and control appliances using an interface 
      while also covering faults that may occur during the whole process.

    </pre>
    
    <p>What are the main Features needed?</p>

    <pre>
    
      Data handling: data security, data backup, data access restriction
      Sensor data precision and accuracy
      Realtime health monitoring
      Fault notifying system

    </pre>

    <p>What are some Smart-building scenarios?</p>

    <pre>
    
      Security (Intruder detection)
      Congestion avoidance detection
      Air quality monitoring and ventilation
      Turning on and off appliances automatically based on its usage hence saving electricity.
